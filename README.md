Hi, I’m @KasperNissen1997.\
I'm 23 years old, soon to be 24, and I study Computer Science at the Southern University of Denmark. I'm currently learning about linear algebra, algorithms and possibility.\
Besides studying, I like to work on small projects in Unity in my freetime, as well as immersing myself in video games.

I can be reached by mail at:\
